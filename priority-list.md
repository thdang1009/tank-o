Priority Development Roadmap

  HIGH PRIORITY (Critical for core functionality)

  1. Multiplayer Core Features
    - Complete lobby system implementation
    - Implement real-time game synchronization
    - Add player state management across clients
  2. Game Mechanics Implementation
    - Finish all tank class abilities and skills
    - Implement all game modes (Battle Royale, CTF, Team modes)
    - Add collision detection and physics

  MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important for user experience)

  3. UI/UX Improvements
    - Complete all game scenes (missing interactions)
    - Add proper error handling and user feedback
    - Implement responsive design
  4. Performance Optimization
    - Add object pooling for bullets/particles
    - Implement efficient network updates
    - Add client-side prediction
  5. Testing & Quality
    - Set up unit tests for shared code
    - Add integration tests for multiplayer
    - Implement linting and code formatting

  MEDIUM-LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have)

  6. Advanced Features
    - Add player statistics and leaderboards
    - Implement spectator mode
    - Add replay system
  7. DevOps & Deployment
    - Set up Docker containerization
    - Configure CI/CD pipeline
    - Add monitoring and analytics

  LOW PRIORITY (Future enhancements)

  8. Polish & Extras
    - Add more maps and game modes
    - Implement achievements system
    - Add customization options
  9. Server Architecture Enhancement
    - ~~Migrate server to TypeScript for better type safety~~ I'm a big fan of vanilla JS, no need to TypeScript it now
    - Implement proper server structure (/server/src/ organization)
    - Add error handling and logging system

  Recommended Next Step: Start with #1 (Server Architecture Enhancement) since it will provide a solid foundation for implementing the
  multiplayer features.
