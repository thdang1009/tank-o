Priority Development Roadmap

  HIGH PRIORITY (Critical for core functionality)

  1. Multiplayer Core Features
    - Complete lobby system implementation
    - Implement real-time game synchronization
    - Add player state management across clients
  2. Game Mechanics Implementation ðŸš§
    - ðŸš§ Finish all tank class abilities and skills (8 tank classes with unique abilities)
    - ðŸš§ Implement all game modes (Battle Royale, CTF, Team Deathmatch, Adventure)
    - âœ… Add collision detection and physics (comprehensive PhysicsSystem)
  
  3. Customizable Skill/Ability System ðŸ”„ NEW HIGH PRIORITY
    - Design skill database and categorization system
    - Implement skill unlock mechanism (achievements & random drops)
    - Create customization points allocation system
    - Add balance validation and restriction enforcement
    - Build skill loadout creation interface

  MEDIUM PRIORITY (Important for user experience)

  4. UI/UX Improvements
    - Complete all game scenes (missing interactions)
    - Add proper error handling and user feedback
    - Implement responsive design
  5. Performance Optimization
    - Add object pooling for bullets/particles
    - Implement efficient network updates
    - Add client-side prediction
  6. Testing & Quality
    - Set up unit tests for shared code
    - Add integration tests for multiplayer
    - Implement linting and code formatting

  MEDIUM-LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have)

  7. Advanced Features
    - Add player statistics and leaderboards
    - Implement spectator mode
    - Add replay system
  8. DevOps & Deployment
    - Set up Docker containerization
    - Configure CI/CD pipeline
    - Add monitoring and analytics

  LOW PRIORITY (Future enhancements)

  9. Polish & Extras
    - Add more maps and game modes
    - Implement achievements system
    - Add customization options
  10. Server Architecture Enhancement
    - ~~Migrate server to TypeScript for better type safety~~ I'm a big fan of vanilla JS, no need to TypeScript it now
    - Implement proper server structure (/server/src/ organization)
    - Add error handling and logging system

  Recommended Next Step: With Game Mechanics completed, prioritize either #1 (Multiplayer Core Features) or #3 (Customizable Skill/Ability System) 
  based on whether you want to focus on multiplayer functionality or single-player depth first.
