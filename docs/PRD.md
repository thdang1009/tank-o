    * **Skill 1: Gravitational Pull:** Creates a small field that pulls enemies towards its center, grouping them up for allies or pulling them off objectives.
    * **Skill 2: Anti-Gravity Field:** Creates a zone where enemy projectiles are significantly slowed or deflected, providing temporary defensive cover.
    * **Ultimate: Black Hole Singularity:** Creates a powerful singularity that violently pulls all enemies in a large radius towards its center, dealing massive damage and holding them in place for a short duration. Devastating in boss rooms with many smaller enemies or for setting up massive damage combos.
    * **New Ideas:**
        * **Time Manipulator Tank (The "Chronomancer"):** *Concept:* Alters the flow of time for enemies and allies. Skill 1: **Temporal Slow** (fires a projectile that creates a zone, slowing enemy movement and attack speed). Skill 2: **Haste Field** (creates a small zone that speeds up allied movement and skill cooldowns). Ultimate: **Rewind Cascade** (briefly rewinds all allies within a large area to their position and health from a few seconds ago, negating recent damage or repositioning errors).
        * **Illusion Tank (The "Phantom"):** *Concept:* Creates deceptive illusions and misdirection to confuse enemies. Skill 1: **Decoy Mirage** (creates a stationary, temporary illusion of the tank that draws enemy fire). Skill 2: **Vision Blur** (sends out a wave that briefly distorts the vision of enemies caught in it, causing them to see false targets or obscured paths). Ultimate: **Grand Illusion** (creates multiple moving illusions of the tank, each taking damage like the real tank, making it nearly impossible for enemies to target the real one for a short duration).
        * **Magnetic Tank (The "Polarizer"):** *Concept:* Manipulates magnetic forces to pull/push metal objects and disarm enemies. Skill 1: **Magnetic Pull** (emits a pulse that pulls metallic enemies or dropped items towards the tank). Skill 2: **EMP Disarm** (fires a projectile that disarms enemies, forcing them to drop their primary weapons for a short time). Ultimate: **Magnetic Flux** (creates a powerful magnetic field that continuously pulls enemies towards a central point while simultaneously pushing away incoming projectiles, creating a deadly vortex).

* **Swarm Tank (The "Hive")**
    * **Concept:** Summons smaller robotic drones to assist in combat, providing continuous pressure and distraction.
    * **Skill 1: Mini-Drone Deploy:** Deploys 2-3 small, weak drones that auto-attack nearby enemies. Drones have a limited lifespan.
    * **Skill 2: Drone Swarm:** Orders all active drones to focus fire on a single target, increasing their attack speed and coordinating damage.
    * **Ultimate: Replicating Drones:** Deploys a larger, more resilient drone that continuously spawns smaller attack drones for a duration. The ultimate drone can also self-destruct for large area damage upon expiring or being manually triggered.
    * **New Ideas:**
        * **Engineer Tank (The "Constructor"):** *Concept:* Deploys various automated turrets and defensive structures. Skill 1: **Auto-Turret Deploy** (places a small, stationary turret that fires at nearby enemies). Skill 2: **Barrier Emitter** (deploys a short-lived energy barrier that blocks projectiles). Ultimate: **Defensive Network** (deploys multiple powerful turrets and connects them with energy beams that damage enemies passing through, creating a fortified zone).
        * **Parasite Tank (The "Leech"):** *Concept:* Attaches to enemies, draining their health/resources and converting them into buffs for itself or allies. Skill 1: **Adhesive Mine** (launches a sticky mine that attaches to an enemy, draining a small amount of their health over time). Skill 2: **Resource Siphon** (targets a defeated enemy or resource node, rapidly extracting its essence to gain a temporary buff or heal). Ultimate: **Host Infestation** (attaches to a single boss or elite enemy, continuously draining its health and applying a stacking debuff, while empowering the Parasite Tank and nearby allies with bonuses based on the drained health).
        * **Artificer Tank (The "Inventor"):** *Concept:* Can dynamically combine and adapt its abilities by creating temporary, unique constructs. Skill 1: **Module Forge: Offense** (creates a temporary offensive module that enhances basic attacks). Skill 2: **Module Forge: Defense** (creates a temporary defensive module that provides a small shield). Ultimate: **Omni-Construct** (combines all active modules and a new special module into a powerful, temporary autonomous combat vehicle that fights alongside the Artificer, firing enhanced attacks and providing a defensive aura).

### 4.4. Tank Naming and Details

* Each tank will have a specific name closely related to its class and characteristics to help players easily visualize and feel connected.
* A detailed tank screen will display clear stats and skill descriptions for each tank.

### 4.5. In-Match Tank Progression System

* Each tank will only level up **within a single match**. The purpose is to minimize the gap between veteran and new players, focusing on individual skill.
* In-match upgrades will provide minor advantages; overall success depends on player skill.
* **TBD:** Specific mechanics of in-match upgrades.

## 4.6. Collection and Custom Tank System Mechanics

This system empowers players to personalize their tanks, offering strategic depth and unique gameplay experiences. It balances creative freedom with competitive fairness, ensuring that skill remains paramount.

---

### 4.6.1. Core Customization Components

Players will collect and apply various components to customize their tanks. Each component will belong to a specific category and have a **Point Cost** and one or more **Affinity Tags**.

* **Ability Slots (Up to 3):**
    * These slots allow players to equip active or passive skills that augment their tank's base capabilities.
    * Examples: `Rapid Reload` (passive, reduces cooldowns), `Emergency Boost` (active, short speed burst), `Armor Coating` (passive, temporary defense buff after taking damage).
    * Each ability has its own **Point Cost**.
* **Weapon Modifiers (1 Slot):**
    * These alter the tank's basic attack behavior, offering tactical variety.
    * Examples: `Piercing Rounds` (basic attacks ignore a portion of enemy defense), `Ricochet Shot` (basic attacks bounce to a nearby enemy), `Shrapnel Blast` (basic attacks deal minor splash damage).
    * Each modifier has a **Point Cost**.
* **Defensive Modules (1 Slot):**
    * These enhance a tank's survivability or crowd control resistance.
    * Examples: `Auto-Repair Field` (slow, continuous HP regen), `Reactive Shield` (brief shield upon taking heavy damage), `Stability Dampeners` (reduces duration of crowd control effects).
    * Each module has a **Point Cost**.
* **Utility Gadgets (1 Slot):**
    * These provide non-combat advantages or unique tactical options.
    * Examples: `Scavenger Drone` (automatically picks up nearby items), `Smoke Emitter` (drops a smoke screen behind the tank while moving), `Grappling Hook` (pulls the tank a short distance to terrain or an enemy).
    * Each gadget has a **Point Cost**.

---

### 4.6.2. Customization Points and Budget

* **Customization Budget:** Each player will have a fixed **Customization Point Budget** (e.g., 20 points, TBD based on balancing) available per tank loadout. This budget is allocated per match or per persistent loadout, preventing excessively strong builds.
* **Point Cost:** Every component (ability, weapon modifier, defensive module, utility gadget) has an assigned **Point Cost** reflecting its power, cooldown, and utility. More impactful components naturally cost more points.
* **Budget Enforcement:** The system strictly enforces the total Customization Points a player can spend. Players cannot exceed their budget, requiring strategic choices.

---

### 4.6.3. Affinity System: Rewarding Synergies, Preventing Overlaps

The **Affinity System** is a core mechanic for balancing customization, preventing overpowered "stacking," and encouraging diverse, thematic builds. Each component will have one or more **Affinity Tags** (e.g., `[Fire]`, `[Ice]`, `[Support]`, `[Defense]`, `[Mobility]`, `[Area_Control]`, `[Single_Target]`, `[Explosive]`, `[Stealth]`).

* **Affinity Bonuses (Positive Synergies):**
    * Equipping multiple components with the **same Affinity Tag** (e.g., two `[Fire]` abilities and a `[Fire]` weapon modifier) will grant a small, cumulative bonus to effects related to that Affinity.
    * **Tiered Bonuses:** These bonuses could be tiered. For example:
        * **2x `[Fire]` Affinity:** +5% Fire Damage.
        * **3x `[Fire]` Affinity:** +10% Fire Damage, -5% Fire Skill Cooldown.
        * **4x `[Fire]` Affinity:** +15% Fire Damage, -10% Fire Skill Cooldown, enemies hit by Fire skills suffer a minor damage-over-time burn.
    * This rewards players for building thematically cohesive and synergistic tank loadouts, making "elemental" or "role-focused" builds feel more potent.
* **Affinity Overload Penalties (Negative Stacking Prevention):**
    * Attempting to equip components that lead to an **excessive concentration of a single, powerful Affinity** beyond a certain threshold will incur a **Point Cost penalty** for subsequent components of that Affinity.
    * For example:
        * If a player selects a third `[High_Damage]` ability, its **Point Cost** might increase by 50%.
        * A fourth `[High_Damage]` component might cost double its usual points, or even become unavailable if the budget cannot cover it.
    * This dynamically increases the cost of hyper-specialized "glass cannon" or "invincible fortress" builds, forcing players to diversify or pay a significant premium in customization points. It prevents players from simply stacking the highest damage or defense components without trade-offs.
* **Class Affinity (Inherent Bias):**
    * Each base **Tank Class** (Damage Dealer, Supporter, Tanker, All-Rounder) has an **inherent, unchangeable Affinity bias**. This bias influences how efficiently they use certain components.
    * For example:
        * A **Tanker Class** might receive a **10-15% Point Cost discount** on `[Defense]`-tagged components, making it more efficient for them to build defensively. They are inherently better at utilizing defensive tools.
        * A **Supporter Class** might have a **5-10% increased effectiveness** for `[Support]` or `[Healing]` components, making their healing spells stronger or buffs last longer.
        * Conversely, equipping components that severely clash with a tank's base class affinity (e.g., a pure Damage Dealer trying to heavily invest in `[Support]` skills) might incur a **slight Point Cost penalty** (e.g., +10-20% cost for misaligned components) or provide reduced effectiveness for those skills (e.g., a healing spell on a Damage Dealer might heal for 80% of its normal value). This encourages players to complement their chosen tank's strengths rather than trying to negate them entirely.

---

### 4.6.4. Collection and Unlock System

* **Achievements:** Specific skills/components are unlocked by completing challenges, such as:
    * **Mastery Challenges:** Defeat X enemies with a specific tank, heal Y health, or absorb Z damage.
    * **Boss Takedowns:** Unlock unique components after defeating specific bosses or boss variations.
    * **Exploration Milestones:** Discover hidden areas or complete side objectives on maps.
* **Random Drops (Non-Monetary):** Components can drop as rewards after completing matches (PvE or PvP), from loot crates earned through gameplay (no real-money purchases for crates), or found as secrets on maps. Drop rates will be tuned to be fair and rewarding, not frustrating.
* **Blueprint Fragments:** Some rare or powerful components may require collecting multiple "blueprint fragments" from various sources (e.g., boss drops, rare event rewards) before they can be assembled and unlocked. This adds a longer-term progression goal.
* **Component Shards:** Duplicate components or less desired ones can be "dismantled" into Component Shards, which can then be used to craft specific desired components, offering a deterministic path for unlocks.

---

### 4.6.5. Tank Loadouts and Management

* **Loadout Slots:** Players will have multiple customizable loadout slots per tank, allowing them to save different builds for various game modes or tactical situations (e.g., a "PvE Boss DPS" build, a "PvP Control" build, an "Exploration" build).
* **Preview System:** A clear and intuitive UI will show the total points spent, remaining budget, and any active Affinity bonuses or penalties *in real-time* as players build their loadouts. This provides immediate feedback.
* **Sharing Loadouts:** Players can easily share their custom tank loadouts with friends or the community, fostering build discussions, theory-crafting, and meta-discovery. This can be done via unique share codes or direct in-game sharing.

---

### 4.6.6. Custom Match Challenges with Custom Tanks

The Customizable Tank System directly fuels new challenging gameplay modes, leveraging player creativity:

* **Solo Gauntlet/Challenges:** Players use their custom-built tanks to tackle specific solo objectives, timed runs, or unique boss encounters, competing on leaderboards for bragging rights and rewards.
* **Player-Created Custom Duels/Team Fights (1v1, 2v2, 3v3):** Players can create private rooms, set up custom match rules (e.g., specific map, no ultimate skills, higher point budget), and challenge others to face their unique tank builds. This promotes competitive innovation and allows players to truly test their creations against others in a controlled environment. Leaderboards for these custom challenges could also be implemented.

---

## 4.7. Customizable Skill/Ability System

To enhance player agency and strategic depth, Tank O will feature a customizable skill and ability system, allowing players to tailor their tanks beyond fixed archetypes.

* **Skill Unlocks:** A diverse list of individual skills and abilities (e.g., specific buffs, debuffs, small utility spells, unique basic attack modifiers) will be unlockable. These unlocks can occur through:
    * **Achievements:** Completing specific in-game challenges, milestones, or mastery tasks with different tank types.
    * **Random Drops (No Pay-to-Win):** Receiving skill components or full skills as random drops from completing matches, defeating bosses, or exploring maps. This ensures fair access without requiring real-money purchases.
* **Customization Points:** Players will have a limited pool of **Customization Points** (e.g., 10 or 20, exact value TBD) to allocate to their chosen skills and abilities. Each skill/ability will have a specific point cost, varying based on its power and utility.
* **Balance Restrictions:** The system will incorporate restrictions to prevent "super strong and over-point" combinations. This could include:
    * **Point Caps:** Strict enforcement of the total Customization Points a player can spend.
    * **Interdependency Rules:** Certain skills might have prerequisites or be mutually exclusive with others.
    * **Class-Specific Restrictions:** Some skills might only be equippable by certain tank classes (e.g., a powerful healing skill only available to Supporters).
    * **Automated Validation:** The game will automatically validate custom loadouts to ensure they adhere to balance rules before a match begins.
* **Custom Match Challenges:** This customization system will enable new challenge modes:
    * **Solo Challenges:** Players can use their custom-built tanks to tackle specific solo objectives or boss fights, competing for high scores.
    * **Player-Created Challenges:** Players can create custom match rooms (e.g., 1v1, 2v2, 3v3) and challenge others to face their unique tank builds. This fosters community interaction and competitive innovation.
