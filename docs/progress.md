## Technical Debt & Architecture Concerns

### üîß **Code Quality Issues**
- **Entity Synchronization**: No proper multiplayer state management
- **Performance Optimization**: Basic bullet/object pooling not implemented
- **Error Handling**: Limited error handling in socket communications
- **Testing**: No test suite implementation found

### üîß **Missing Infrastructure**
- **Authentication System**: No user authentication beyond local username
- **Data Persistence**: No proper player data storage system
- **Security**: No anti-cheat or data validation systems
- **Monitoring**: No performance or error monitoring

## Alignment with PRD Requirements

### ‚úÖ **Well Aligned**
- Core tank combat system matches PRD vision
- Tank class system aligns with 4 main categories requirement
- Basic multiplayer architecture supports PRD goals
- Scene flow and UI structure matches expected user journey

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Aligned**
- Game modes exist but lack full feature set from PRD
- Tank stats system implemented but missing progression mechanics
- Social features have UI but lack functionality

### ‚ùå **Not Aligned**
- Missing 60% of specified game modes and features
- No creative mode implementation
- Missing advanced tank types and abilities
- No achievement/mastery system
- Missing environmental interaction and physics
- No donation/server expansion system

## Development Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (Next Sprint)
1. **Complete Multiplayer Foundation**: Implement real-time player synchronization
2. **Implement Basic Items System**: Add collectible items and basic effects
3. **Add Missing Tank Types**: Implement at least 2-3 additional specialized tank classes
4. **Complete Solo Mode**: Add proper enemy AI and wave progression

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Implement Team-based Modes**: Focus on Stage mode (Team Up PvE)
2. **Add Boss Battle System**: Create boss encounters and ultimate skills
3. **Implement User Persistence**: Add proper account system and progress saving
4. **Performance Optimization**: Add object pooling and optimize rendering

### Long-term Vision
1. **Creative Mode Implementation**: Map and tank creation tools
2. **Advanced Physics**: Environmental destruction and realistic physics
3. **Community Features**: Sharing, rating, and social systems
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls and responsive design

## Estimated Completion Status: **35%**

The project has a solid foundation with core gameplay mechanics working well. However, significant development effort is needed to achieve the full vision outlined in the PRD. The architecture is scalable and well-structured, providing a good foundation for future development.
